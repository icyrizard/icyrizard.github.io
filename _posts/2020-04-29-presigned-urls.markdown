Recently I've been working on a project to further upgrade the security for the company that I work for.
This blog post will cover some of my learnings during this project. The examples will be in PHP, while I do have my 
opinion about PHP, it's the safest way for me to guarantee that my examples work :).

[comment]: <> (// guide will give an in depth description on how to setup presigned urls on your AWS S3 bucket. )

## A Little Background Story
Users directly upload pictures to our platform, during the upload process they are resized into two types of sizes, a thumbnail
size and a preview size. This yields 3 images that are stored on S3, each with saved with a long string of random characters into an
S3 bucket. Now, there is no way on earth someone could guess the names of these images, even given the fact that
we store an insane amount of images, our human brain cannot comprehend the size of the search space in which an attacker
has to go through to be very very lucky...

Now, that said, a fair remark that came my why on this is was,

> *"What if the paths to the s3 bucket objects were leaked? Somehow?".* 

I won't get into the details of this, but this is a valid remark because evil forces with the right access pass, will no doubly
be able to pull something off like this. So, in short, we need to block public access to our bucket. This can be done
by either using Signed or Presigned URLS.

## What are Signed URLS?
For the Signed URLs mechanism, the backend application will generate URLS that are signed. The link generated will
point towards a CloudFront Distribution that is able to verify the signing hidden in the requests parameters.

## What are Pre-signed URLS?
AWS Presigned URLS allow for temporarily grant specific rights to someone with the link. This being, to **read**, **write** or **delete**
objects in S3. From a server side perspective, this could simply mean that we generate the Presigned URL on the server and that link to 
the client. The client can use the URLs to perform the desired operation, depending on the access right granted by the server.

A prerequisites is that the server needs to have access (by means of a IAM Role and Policy) to the location to the 
Bucket and Path for which it is generating a Presigned URL. You can either use an AWS Key and AWS Secret, 
but it's far more secure to use the Role that is attached to the service of backend entity in AWS. To use it,
you should use the [Aws\Credentials\CredentialsInterface](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-php/v3/developer-guide/guide_configuration.html), 
and use the credentials so setup the`S3Client`. An example of this is shown in Listings 1.

This will prevent long reuse of an AWS Key and Secret, this reduces the risk of those keys being leaked in any way and be active forever without knowing. 
Role based access will give you full power in what is allowed by that specific role. Another benefit is that is a less expensive operation.

## The Goal
In the end, we want users to use a link to our backend server and get automatically redirected to S3 with a presigned url or signed url.
The choice for the current implementation has fallen on the Pre-signed urls. It requires one less entity in the scheme of things,
and we do not need the access to the AWS root account to create a key pair, so for our situation Presigned URLS were our best pick.

1. The user logs in to our platform
2. Retrieves resources and their attachments
3. The attachments have links directly leading to our Backend.
4. We check if they have a valid login and if they are allowed to see the current requested resource using their access key.

### AWS S3 Client Initialization
This documentation is a bit misleading on what you should supply as the credentials option for the S3Client:

**Copied from the AWS Docs on AWS S3 Client Credentials initialisation:**
> If you donâ€™t provide a credentials option, the SDK attempts to load credentials from your environment in the following order:
>  1. Load credentials from environment variables.
>  1. Load credentials from a credentials .ini file.
>  1. Load credentials from an IAM role. 

But if yoo provide an object of type `Aws\CacheInterface`, you will get the AWS Key and Secret that the S3Client that is has gotten itself from the IAM Role. 
The AWS Key and Secret it has retrieved from the 
[EC2 Service Metadata](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/zh_cn/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/guide/credentials.html#using-iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2-container-service-tasks)
, which is retrieved by means of a request. This is obviously slower than if were to store those keys temporarily which can be reused.

### Getting an S3 Object with a Presigned URL
Following the Example on the [AWS Documentation on PresignedURLs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RetrieveObjSingleOpPHP.html),
and combining this the `Aws\Credentials\CredentialsInterface`, we get the following
result for retrieving an object using the presigned URL. Note that this not the result we are aiming for yet... we don't want to
download the object in the Backend, we want to give the sweet task of the downloading the object to the client.

~~~php
<?php

/**
 * Use get and set to store your credentials in a Cache that can be quickly accessed.
 * 
* Class CacheObject
 */
class CacheObject implements Aws\CacheInterface {
    public function get($key) {}
    public function set($key, $value, $ttl = 0) {}
    public function remove($key) {}
}

... 

$bucket = 'derp-bucket';
$keyname = 'uploads/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.jpg';

$credentials = new CacheObject();

$s3 = new Aws\S3\S3Client([
  'version'     => 'latest',
  'region'      => 'eu-west-1',
  'credentials' => $credentials
]);

try {
  // Get the object.
  $result = $s3->getObject([
      'Bucket' => $bucket,
      'Key'  => $keyname
  ]);

  // Display the object in the browser.
  header("Content-Type: {$result['ContentType']}");

  echo $result['Body'];
} catch (S3Exception $e) {
    echo $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
}
~~~

This is nice, but we don't want the actual file, we want the client to fetch it instead. We just need the URL and send
an HTTP Redirect so the client can follow that link instead.

### Getting a Presigned URL.
Now remember that the Goal is to redirect the user to the S3 Bucket, after we have checked their login. So we have
to generate the Presigned URL by the following snippet:

~~~php
$lifetime = 60;

$cmd = $s3->getCommand('GetObject', [
    'Bucket' => $bucket
    'Key' => $keyName,
]);

$presignedUrlRequest = $this->S3->createPresignedRequest($cmd, DateUtils::time() + $lifetime);
$presignedUrl = (string)$presignedUrlRequest->getUri(); 

return $presignedUrl;
~~~

An important part was to cast the result of the getUri function to a String. It returns an object that contains
a toString method. Not converting it will give you hours of fun debugging, you're welcome :).
~~~php
$presignedUrl = (string)$presignedUrlRequest->getUri();
~~~

### Sending the Redirect to the Client
Now that we have the URL we can send a 303 to with the location header set to the Presigned URL. The HTTP Client of
the user will automatically follow the redirect and start downloading the S3 Object. Now at this moment a problem arose.
This problem is discussed in the following Section.

#### The Authorization Header Problem
The `Authorization Header` is not usable now. You cannot use the Authorization Header to authenticate the user on your platform
AND send a redirect to AWS. Strangely enough, the Authorization Header is not stripped after a redirect. That's something
I never realized. To prevent this, a Cookie Authorization must be used and sent by the Client when requesting access
to an S3 Object. Cookies are automatically stripped or included based on the domain that is receiving them. This sinply does not hold for
the Authorization Header. Weird huh? The Authorization Header is the modern version of the Cookie Header, yet it is 
less secure considering this.

~~~xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Error><Code>InvalidArgument</Code>
<Message>Only one auth mechanism allowed; only the X-Amz-Algorithm query parameter, Signature query string parameter or the Authorization header should be specified</Message>
<ArgumentName>Authorization</ArgumentName>
    <ArgumentValue>Bearer accesskey=derp</ArgumentValue><RequestId>
</RequestId>
    <HostId>...</HostId>
</Error>
~~~

In the Presigned URL the X-Amz-Algorithm contains
