My name is Richard Torenvliet. I've studied Computer Science BSc on the UvA
(Univesiteit van Amsterdam) and finished my MSc on the VU (Vrij Universiteit van
Amsterdam). Through the years I've worked both on both personal, study related
and work problems and decided that some of them deserve some 'writing down'.
Both for everyone to learn from and for me to see if I (still) understand some
of them. My experiences and knowledge varies both from backend and frontend,
from AWS Infrastructure to databases, from Ember to React, from Python to PHP.
Some of the problems I've encountered I still find interesting enough to write
down. So expect a blog that contains guides / stories / remarks on some of
problems that are not always obvious, (at least for me past self anyway).
