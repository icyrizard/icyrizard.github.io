<p>Welcome to my blog <a href="https://icyrizard.github.io">CodeDerps</a>}, for those that are interested, I’m is <strong>Richard Torenvliet</strong>, born and raised in Amsterdam.
I’ve completed a Computer Science BSc on the UvA (Universiteit van Amsterdam) and finished my MSc on the VU (Vrij Universiteit van
Amsterdam). Although important for some companies, there are other ways you can expand your knowledge… this just happened
to be my road to it. Ever since I was 13 years old, I tried to learn ActionScript to make cool animations on the web. This language was used by Flash 
(a paid Application), but also by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWiSH_Max">Swish</a>, a free alternative. 
If you don’t know what I’m talking about, I think it’s for the better! I remember I was so frustrated by the fact that I couldn’t
understand of how a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forloop</code> worked. This frustration kept with me for so long, that after high school I was determined to study
Computer Science to find out how the heck I can build those awesome animations I was dreaming about since I was a little boy.</p>

<p>Learning to create cool animations is of course not what this study is about, in fact, Web Development was only one small portion
of the total curriculum. I was so naive… Luckily, something far greater happened was in store for me than learning how to create those animations. Before even knowing what
programming was, we started getting lectures about how the computer itself worked, on a hardware level. We learned how
such a complex components like the processor can actually be build from a bunch of <a href="https://hackaday.com/2016/02/24/8-bit-computer-made-solely-from-nand-gates/">NAND</a> gates.
Such complex components and concepts, somehow became more and more understandable with each passing week, and that felt liberating. I knew I picked the right study. Finally
I was learning interesting stuff instead of ‘Who was the writer of “Klucht van de Koe” in the 1700’s’. That stuff we learned at High School I mean.</p>

<p>Although with each passing week my knowledge was expanding, we did not really learn about Web Development. But if you 
manage to learn how to do that, you can actually show some of your knowledge to friends and make maybe even make those cool animations!
Since the start of my study the years I’ve worked tons of personal projects. With this new skill I’ve obtained, there was just an endless amount
of possibilities. The experience I’ve gained in my personal projects, led to my first coding job at de CodeFabriek. 
I was putting my knowledge to work, rookie that I was. Back then I was constantly writing code that already was build into the
standard library. That was definitely disappointing at times, but damn, I was learning! From one coding job came another and finally 
currently reached 8 years of work experience with using various tools and frameworks. My experiences and knowledge varies both from backend and frontend, from self hosted applications to using
AWS Infrastructure, from Ember to React, from Python and PHP. I’ve seen a fair share of different problems and decided that some of them deserved to be written down.</p>

<p>Some of the problems I’ve encountered I still find interesting enough to write down. So expect a blog that contains guides / stories / remarks on some problems that are not always obvious.
They can be useful for anyone, and maybe even more so for myself.</p>
